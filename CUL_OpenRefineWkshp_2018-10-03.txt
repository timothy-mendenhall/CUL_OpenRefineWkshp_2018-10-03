If OpenRefine doesn't open in your browser, or if you accidentally close the browser window with OpenRefine, try plugging in one of the following addresses:

Copy-and-paste: Regular Expressions (Regex) and GREL for exercises
GREL Syntax for regexes : value.replace(/{regex}/, "{replacement}")

In demo: 
Regex to remove parenthetical qualifiers from Genre column:
value.replace(/ \(.+/,"")

Exercise 6
value.replace(/\.$/, "")

Exercise 7
value.replace(/(\d{2})\/(\d{2})\/(\d{4})/, "$3-$1-$2")

Demo: Text filter for every record with a single-word subject in Subject column:
^[a-zA-Z]+$


Exercise 9:

In Collection column, perform an Edit Cells-->Transform task with the GREL expression:
cells["Location"].value + "; " + value

ALTERNATE method: In Collection column, Edit Column --> Add column based on this column
cells["Location"].value + "; " + value

ALTERNATE method (use when viewing data in record view, discussed in the Splitting/Joining cells section): In Collection column, perform an Edit Cells-->Transform task with the GREL expression:
row.record.cells.Location.value[0] + ", " + value
